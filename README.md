<!-- start summary -->
Keras layers without using matrix multiplications.

This is a Keras based implementation of some layers mentioned in the papers [*The Era of 1-bit LLMs: All Large Language Models are in 1.58 Bits*](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.17764v1) and [*Scalable MatMul-free Language Modeling*](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.02528v5). <!-- end summary --> Find the documentation [here](https://keras-matmulless.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

## Rationale
<!-- start rationale -->

Traditional, matrix multiplication based layers suffer from a few issues.

1. They have high inference and computational costs due to the use of matrix multiplications. This hinders the speed at which inference is performed on GPU-less machines.
2. The memory use for storing full precision weights is very high.
3. The energy costs of running matrix multiplications is very high.

Matrix multiplication free layers addresses these pain points by removing the key source of costs &mdash; matrix multiplications.

## Installation
<!-- start installation -->

For now, the only way to install Keras-MML is via GitHub.

The requirements for the package are:

- Python 3.9 (and above)

### Installation via GitHub

First, clone the repository using

```bash
git clone https://github.com/PhotonicGluon/Keras-MatMulLess.git
cd Keras-MatMulLess
```

We recommend to create a virtual environment to install [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) and the other dependencies into.

```bash
python -m venv venv  # If `python` doesn't work, try `python3`
```

Activate the virtual environment using

```bash
source venv/bin/activate
```

or, if you are on Windows,

```bash
venv/Scripts/activate
```

Now we install Poetry.

```bash
pip install poetry
```

Finally, install the development dependencies.

```bash
poetry install --with dev
```

If you have not installed a backend (i.e., [Tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/), [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/), or [Jax](https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html)) you can do so here.

```bash
poetry install --with dev,BACKEND_NAME
```

Note that the `BACKEND_NAME` to be specified here is

- `tensorflow` for the Tensorflow backend;
- `torch` for the PyTorch backend; and
- `jax` for the Jax backend.

That's it! You should now have access to the `keras_mml` package.

### Installation Issues

These are some of the known issues faced when installing Keras-MML.

#### Development Installation With `torch` Backend

*This is a known issue when installing Keras-MML with `dev` and `torch` on **AArch64** (i.e., **ARM64**) systems.*

Attempting to install the `torch` backend using

```bash
poetry install --with torch
```

fails with a message like `Unable to find installation candidates for torch (2.2.2+cpu)`. To remedy, run

```bash
pip install torch~=2.2.2 torchvision~=0.17.2 torchaudio~=2.2.2
```

<!-- end installation -->

## Quickstart

Read the [tutorial](https://keras-matmulless.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting-started/tutorial.html).

## Using Dev Containers

[![CPU Dev Container](https://img.shields.io/static/v1?label=CPU%20Dev%20Container&message=Open&color=blue&logo=visualstudiocode)](https://vscode.dev/redirect?url=vscode://ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers/cloneInVolume?url=https://github.com/PhotonicGluon/Keras-MatMulLess)

If you already have VS Code and Docker installed, you can click the badge above or [here](https://vscode.dev/redirect?url=vscode://ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers/cloneInVolume?url=https://github.com/PhotonicGluon/Keras-MatMulLess) to get started. Clicking these links will cause VS Code to automatically install the Dev Containers extension if needed, clone the source code into a container volume, and spin up a dev container for use.

### CUDA

Keras-MML offers a `cuda` dev container for working with CUDA.

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> Edit the [`Dockerfile`](.devcontainer/cuda/Dockerfile) file to set up the architecture properly.
> By default it is using `amd64`. So, if you are on a `arm64` system, **uncomment the appropriate lines in the file**!
